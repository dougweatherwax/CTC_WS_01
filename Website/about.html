                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Clothe to Care was founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to ensure that every family in our community 
                    has access to clean, quality clothing regardless of their financial circumstances. What started as a small 
                    initiative among neighbors in Katy and Fulshear, Texas, has grown into a community-wide movement of 
                    compassion and generosity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recognized that clothing is not just a basic necessity—it's a fundamental aspect of dignity, self-confidence, 
                    and social participation. By connecting generous donors with families in need, we're building bridges of 
                    compassion throughout our community.
